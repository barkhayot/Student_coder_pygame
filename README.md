# Student_coder_pygame
First pygame project (can be updated )
The game has beem completed 

INFORMATION : 

PROJECT : 1 (GAME PROJECT)
NAME : Student VS Zombies (Nut Shooting)
DATE : 2020.06.21
COUNTRY : South Korea 
AUTHOR : Barkhayot (Just Student)
LANGUAGE : PYTHON (PyGame Libr.)
CODE EDITOR : VSCODE 
OS : Mac.IOS 


The Game has Simple Algorithm and Simple meaning. Student or The gyu should shoot the Zombie that moves to his side. As the weapon
I used the Nut. To be honest I am not really focused on GUI application and Game Projects. I am more interested to wokr with algorithms and 
solving problems with them. But I have to note that playing with Pygame was also much interesting. I tried to build interesting game. The Python Language is used for this project with PYGAME and PIP3 library.
I spend a week for this project all soursec and files were available on internet for free. I think it can be really interesting 
for Python users to strart build projects with this kind of interesting things. I got a lot of experience with this project and
ecouraged myself to finish it. I would recommend for everey one to build something with animation when all basic tutorials finish.
Anyway would be never stop learning and going to your aim as any kind if Data and everything is available for free nowadays.
